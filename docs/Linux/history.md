# History

up / down arrows to cycle through previous commands

`history`

each previous command has a number, which can be used to execute that command, e.g.:<br>
`!123`, if the command had number 123

## avoid a command from showing up in the history
add a space in front, e.g.<br>
` groups`<br>
usefull if the command contains a password for example
