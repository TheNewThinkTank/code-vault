"Developers handbook" / "udviklerens ståbi"

Welcome to the Snippet Hive / Tech Trove / Code Cabinet / Script Sanctuary.

My personal collection of recipes for BASH, Git, Docker and more,
intended primarily for my own daily work and as a quick reference.

the main goal is quick access to a lot of relevant info

Feel free to use these if you find them helpful,
but don't expect any certain structure, explanation or consistency.
